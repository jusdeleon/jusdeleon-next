# Justin De Leon

Hey there 👋 

I’m a web developer based in the Philippines. I mostly do back-end work using PHP and Laravel. I also work with a little front-end using Tailwind, Alpine, Vue, and React.

I like learning and playing around with new tech. Outside of programming, I'm into running, sneakers, anime, tv series, and video games.
